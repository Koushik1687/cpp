Mumbai:
Mumbai Police are investigating if Kunal Kamra's jokes targeting Shiv Sena chief Eknath Shinde 
were part of a conspiracy and whether the comic received money or any other form of help to mock 
the Maharashtra Chief Minister, sources have said.

A team from Khar police station visited Kunal Kamra's Mumbai home, 
where his parents say, with a summons, 
asking the comic to appear for questioning in connection with the cases against him. 
Since the comic is believed to have left the state, the summons has been sent to his WhatsApp number too. 
Kamra faces multiple charges, including defamation and statements conducing to public mischief.
